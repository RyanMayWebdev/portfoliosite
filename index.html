                    <h2>Hey, I'm Ryan May!</h2>
                    <p>I'm a web developer who is passionate about coding and being creative. I'm constantly looking to
                        grow,
                        seeking out new ideas, learning new technologies and researching various methods to achieve my
                        goals.
                        Just like watching the seedlings in my garden grow, I love seeing a project start from a spark
                        of an
                        idea to a full blown website or application.
                        Coding is something I have fallen in love with, I get blissfully lost within it and before I
                        know
                        it,
                        day has turned into night.
                        This coupled with a life long work ethic of working hard, never giving up and doing what needs
                        to be
                        done has given me the skills required to complete any task.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to programming, I have an overall love for computers and technology. If I'm not
                        spending
                        my
                        time coding, you'll probably find me gaming, playing vr, building a pc, redoing my watercooling
                        loop or researching either the
                        latest
                        tech or whatever random idea comes to mind (Just ask my wife how often I'm researching something
                        on
                        my
                        phone).
                        And if I'm not doing that, I'll probably be cooking, trying out my newest idea for a recipe or
                        tending
                        to my herb and vegatable gardens.

                                that pop of colour that brings every together. I have a good amount of confidence using CSS as well as BootStrap, but
                                of course there is always something new to learn and I look forward to that. </p>

                                and more recently C++, JavaScript just felt natural.
                                With a knowledge of programming fundamentals and a curiosity to learn, I've come a long way
                                with JavaScript in a short amount of time. I love being able to add interactivity to a site,
                                solve problems and bring life to a website. My knowledge of JS includes JQuery, ES6 and Node.JS</p>
